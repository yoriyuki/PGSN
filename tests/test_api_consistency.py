"""The public API and the XML builtin table must not drift apart.

`pgsn.__all__` and `pgsn_xml._BUILTINS` expose the same standard library of
PGSN terms through two different front ends.  Nothing links them at runtime, so
a name added to one is easily forgotten in the other.  These tests pin the
relationship down: every term-valued name is available under the same spelling
on both sides, with no exceptions beyond the GSN class aliases below.

Only *term-valued* names are compared.  The public API additionally exports
Python functions that build terms out of Python values (`string`, `record`,
`lambda_abs`, ...); XML has syntax for those instead of names, so they have no
counterpart in the builtin table.
